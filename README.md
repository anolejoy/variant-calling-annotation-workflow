# Variant Calling and Annotation Mini Project

## Overview
This repository demonstrates my understanding of the NGS variant calling and annotation workflow,
from variant identification to clinical interpretation.

## Objectives
- Understand the variant calling pipeline (FASTQ → BAM → VCF)
- Perform variant annotation using Ensembl VEP
- Interpret variants using clinical databases

## Workflow Summary
1. Raw sequencing data is aligned to a reference genome (conceptual understanding).
2. Variants are called to produce VCF files.
3. Variants are annotated using Ensembl VEP.
4. Annotated variants are interpreted for clinical relevance.

## Tools and Resources
- Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)
- ClinVar
- gnomAD

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of NGS file formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF)
- Variant annotation and interpretation
- Clinical variant prioritisation
- Clear scientific documentation

## Future Development
- Run variant calling pipelines using GATK on tutorial datasets
- Apply variant filtering strategies
- Explore somatic variant calling workflows
- Learn basic command-line processing of BAM and VCF files
