# Variant Interpretation

## Variant 1: BRCA1
- Gene: BRCA1
- Genomic position: chr17:43071077
- Variant: c.5266dupC
- Consequence: Frameshift variant
- gnomAD frequency: Extremely rare
- ClinVar classification: Pathogenic

### Clinical Interpretation
This frameshift variant results in a truncated BRCA1 protein and is a well-established
pathogenic variant associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.
Its rarity in the general population and strong clinical evidence support pathogenicity.

## Variant 2: CFTR
- Gene: CFTR
- Genomic position: chr7:117199644
- Variant: c.1521_1523delCTT (ΔF508)
- Consequence: In-frame deletion
- gnomAD frequency: Low
- ClinVar classification: Pathogenic

### Clinical Interpretation
This variant is the most common pathogenic variant associated with cystic fibrosis.
It disrupts CFTR protein folding and function and is widely reported in clinical databases.
